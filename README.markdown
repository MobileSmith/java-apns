Once upon a time, when the king was away, the castle of notnoop/java-apns
fell into disrepair. All the knights moved out and built the temporary
settlement of java-apns/java-apns.

But one beautiful day the king sent the keys to his old castle and
the knights returned home. Now they care about the castle again
and they lived happily ever after.
